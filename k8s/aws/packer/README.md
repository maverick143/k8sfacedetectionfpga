# Amazon EKS AMI Build Specification

This repository contains resources and configuration scripts for building the
fpga-worker-node custom Amazon EKS AMI with [HashiCorp Packer](https://www.packer.io/). 
This is a modified configuration of what Amazon EKS uses to create the official Amazon
EKS-optimized AMI.

## Setup

You must have [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) installed on your local system.
For more information, see [Installing Packer](https://www.packer.io/docs/install/index.html)
in the Packer documentation. You must also have AWS account credentials
configured so that Packer can make calls to AWS API operations on your behalf.
For more information, see [Authentication](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/amazon.html#specifying-amazon-credentials)
in the Packer documentation.

## Building the AMI

A Makefile is provided to build the AMI, but it is just a small wrapper around
invoking Packer directly. You can initiate the build process by running the
following command in the root of this repository:

```bash
make 1.14
```

The Makefile runs Packer with the `eks-worker-al2.json` build specification
template and the [amazon-ebs](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/amazon-ebs.html)
builder. An instance is launched and the Packer [Shell
Provisioner](https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/shell.html) runs the
`install-worker.sh` script on the instance to install software and perform other
necessary configuration tasks.  Then, Packer creates an AMI from the instance
and terminates the instance after the AMI is created.
